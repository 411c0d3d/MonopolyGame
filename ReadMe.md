## Features

- **Real-time multiplayer** — SignalR keeps every client in sync with zero polling
- **Complete ruleset** — all 40 spaces, 32 cards (Chance + Community Chest), rent tables, monopoly bonuses, railroads, utilities, and jail mechanics
- **Trading system** — propose, counter, accept, or reject trades with properties and cash
- **Buildings** — buy houses and hotels per color group with full monopoly validation
- **Mortgage system** — mortgage and unmortgage properties for liquidity
- **Self-managed lobbies** — create a room, share the code, start when ready; host transfers automatically if the host leaves
- **Bot support** — fill empty seats with AI players
- **Turn timer** — auto-advance if a player idles too long
- **Event log** — toggleable live feed of every game action
- **Reconnect recovery** — drop and rejoin mid-game; full state is restored

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Server | ASP.NET Core 10 |
| Real-time transport | SignalR |
| Client | React over Razor (no bundler — plain script tags via index.html) |
| State | Both decoupled storage repository source of truth and In-memory (`Dictionary<string, GameState>`) with JSON file persistence for recovery |
| Serialisation | Strongly-typed DTOs, System.Text.Json |

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** .NET 10 SDK

```bash
git clone https://github.com/411c0d3d/MonopolyGame
cd MonopolyGame
dotnet run --project MonopolyServer
```

Local testing: Open `http://localhost:5299` in your browser. Create a room, add up to 7 bots and play against them.

## Architecture

See [ADR.md](ADR.md) for the full architecture decision record covering:

- **Concurrency model** — how `GameRoomManager` uses a single `_lock` to make compound game operations atomic, and why `ConcurrentDictionary` alone is insufficient
- **SignalR hub design** — thin hub pattern (validate · delegate · broadcast), group management, and the disconnect/reconnect lifecycle
- **React + Razor architecture** — how the shell bootstraps React, the component tree, and why there is no build pipeline
- **Event subscription pattern** — how components subscribe in `useEffect` and always return unsubscribe functions to prevent listener leaks
- **Cleanup routine** — the `GameCleanupService` background timer and how `PurgeExpiredGames()` works under lock

---

## How a Turn Works

```
Player clicks Roll
  → gameHub.call('RollDice', gameId)
      → Hub validates it is the caller's turn
          → GameEngine.RollDice mutates GameState
              → Hub broadcasts GameStateUpdated + DiceRolled to all players
                  → React re-renders board, tokens, and cash
                  → Dice animation plays and settles on real values
                  → The Player takes some actions from the client via signalR
                  → Player Action is sent via hub service and received by GameHub on the server
                  → The GameEngine produces new GameState and triggers the GameHub to update the Clients via SignalR 
```

The server is always the source of truth. The client never modifies game state locally — it waits for `GameStateUpdated` before re-rendering.

---

## Data Layer

- Active game state is held in both memory (`Dictionary<string, GameState>`) for low-latency reads and writes during play. 
- State is additionally persisted to JSON via file I/O, allowing the server to recover in-progress games across restarts without a database dependency. The persistence layer is isolated from the engine — adding a full database backend requires only a new `IGameStateStore` implementation.
- **NoSQL database Support**

---

## Non-Features (Intentional)

- **No auctions by design** — property stays unowned if declined; auctions slow games down
- **Roles or permissions is given via Admin Hub** — everyone can create and host but Admin has its own Panel Client and diagnostics view and is rate-limited
